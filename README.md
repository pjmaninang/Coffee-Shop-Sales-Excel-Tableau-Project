# Coffee-Shop-Sales-Excel-Tableau-Project

## Project Overview

Maven Roasters, a fictional coffee shop with three store locations in New York, is wanting to analyze it's sales and revenue data from the first half of the year in 2023. 

The company has provided a substantial amount of transactional data from January 2023 - June 2023 based on product offerings amongst the three different locations. This project analyzes and visualizes this transactional data in order to uncover critical insights that will help to improve Maven Roaster's success.

Through cleaning and aggregating data in Excel Power Query, as well creating a visualization in Tableau, insights and recommendations were focused on the following key objectives:

- Monitor revenue growth and performance trends – Evaluate monthly and hourly sales patterns across all store locations to identify periods of strong performance and detect potential slowdowns in traffic
- Assess product performance and profitability – Analyzed category and product-level revenue and sales volumes to pinpoint high-value items, as well as underperforming products that may require marketing support, repositioning, or removal from the portfolio
